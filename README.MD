# Crypto Space Invaders

The project is a combination of a Unity game project created while learning on [GameDevTv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) and Web3 elements that use [ChainSafe Web3.Unity SDK](https://github.com/chainsafe/web3.unity).

The game is created to run in the browser using WebGL, for other deployment platforms other web3 functions should be used but it shouldn't be a lot of effort to someone familiar with the SDK.
